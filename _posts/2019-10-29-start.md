Hey friends,
Welcome to my new blog. My name is the Sharvenium and I will be writing blogs at least once a week from today to share epic ideas. Having a website where you can share your thoughts is just epic and so cool. So, I will now be sharing why I decided to start blogging.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    The idea of setting up a personal blog has been swirling around in my head for some time, but Iâ€™ve never before managed to shake the nagging suspicion that to write about my own experiences, ideas, life etc, would be unbelievably narcissistic and should therefore be avoided at all costs.
  </p>
  
  <cite> I would like to start off by sharing a good introductory paragraph from <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/fear-of-blogging/">Ali Abdaal&#8217;s blog</a> which summaries my thoughts about starting a personal blog</cite>
</blockquote>

Firstly, I decided to blog as I wanted a platform where I could share my ideas on tech products, productivity tips and more epic stuff, and I felt that starting my own blog is the best way to achieve that. I decided to invest in this website as I felt that even if only my family and friends read this blog, I would be able to improve my writing skills and learn more about web development, design and marketing through this.

Secondly, blogs are just so cool. It&#8217;s like owning a part of the internet like owning a plot of land in real life. How crazy is that&#8230;

Lastly, I decided to write my own blog after reading other personal blogs from people such as [Ali Abdaal](http://aliabdaal.com), [Matt D&#8217;Avella](https://mattdavella.com/), [Thomas Frank](http://collegeinfogeek.com), [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/) and so many more epic people.

I hope that this process of blogging can help me document my ideas and share useful tips and ideas with you, the cool people that read my blog.

Stay Epic,

Sharvenium
