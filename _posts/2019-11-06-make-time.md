Make Time is another one of those epic productivity books like Getting Things Done by David Allen or Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. 

This book was quite different from other books as it is more like a interview with the two authors with each section being labelled Jake and JZ so that we can understand which methods work for them and how they implemented these strategies in their real life.

This forms a kind of personal connection that we have with the author rather than them just writing down a step by step process on how we can MAKE TIME in our lives for the things we want to do in life. There are also epic illustrations in this book which made it an enjoyable read.

(Check out their blog where you will find insightful articles about this… :D)

There are 4 steps in this MAKE TIME process

## 1 . Highlight

You need to focus on one thing per day, it can be broad if you have lots of stuff to do that are similar (Homework, Cooking etc.) or more specific (Film YouTube video about distraction free iPhone, Complete assignment due tmr etc.)

## 2 . Laser

Next you need to reduce distractions and infinity pools (social media, browsing services, TV etc.) to achieve laser mode

## 3 . Energize

Reset defaults and lead a healthy lifestyle through healthy eating, calm mental state and exercise

## 4 . Reflect

At the end of the day, reflect on how your laser and energise went and whether you achieved your highlight

These 4 steps can help you to be a more epic version of yourself.

Stay Epic,
