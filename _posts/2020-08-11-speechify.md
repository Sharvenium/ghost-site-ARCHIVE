Have you ever wanted to read something but experienced problems with reading or did not have the time in your day to read?

**Speechify** is for you. It was founded by student Cliff Weitzman who loves to read books. 

However, he has a learning difference called dyslexia which makes it hard for him to read. But with <a href="https://getspeechify.com" target="_blank">Speechify</a> he is able to read 100 books a year! 😲

Speechify helps by reading out text to you in a natural human voice. This allows you to **read faster**, **retain more information** and **save more time**.
