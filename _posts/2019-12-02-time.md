“I did not have time to do my homework” is one excuse that teachers would have heard multiple times throughout their career or you may have even used during school. However, when you think about it, no one is ever really busy unless they have such a tightly packed schedule such as Elon Musk. Even so, you might not really be ‘busy’ as you claim you are.

Everyone has the same 24 hours in the day but some people achieve more in these 24 hours than others. Some might be managing two multi-billion dollar companies simultaneously. However others are spending their time buying takeaway from fast food restaurants and binge watching Netflix while playing video games the whole day. It isn’t that you do not have time, it is that you are not prioritizing your time properly. Is it true that you do not have time to go the gym after work or is it because you are currently prioritizing Netflix and Chips over the gym?

Therefore, as we are all fully in control of our time most of the time, we should prioritize the activities and things that would add the most value to our lives and that we would feel accomplished that we did it in a couple of years.

So hopefully you can learn that you are fully in control of your time and that you can do anything you want if you prioritise your time properly.
