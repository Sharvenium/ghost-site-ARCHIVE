Cold Emails are thoroughly underrated for meeting people on the internet and there is practically no downside to it. ✉️

Whenever we want to make a decision we should first analyse the risks and rewards.

Some actions have high risk and low rewards like doing something that is morally wrong while other actions have low risk and very high rewards like cold emailing.

Cold emailing is something that I first learnt from Alex Banyans “The Third Door” book. He uses an amazing analogy of a nightclub as described below. 🚪

> Life, business, success… it’s just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.

> There’s the First Door: the main entrance, where 99 percent of people wait in line, hoping to get in.

> The Second Door: the VIP entrance, where the billionaires and celebrities slip through.

> But what no one tells you is that there is always, always… the Third Door. It’s the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, sneak through the kitchen—there’s always a way.

> Whether it’s how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software or how Steven Spielberg became the youngest studio director in Hollywood history, they all took the Third Door.

In the book Alex has this goal of reaching out to the world’s most successful people and figuring out what they did to be successful. His book documents the different steps he took to meet famous people and how he managed to interview them in their busy schedule.

Everything started with cold emails and he used the cold email technique from Tim Ferriss.

Dear So-and-So,

I know you're really busy and that you get a lot of emails, so this will only take sixty seconds to read.

[Here is where you say who you are: add one or two lines that establish your credibility.]

[Here is where you ask your very specific question.]

I totally understand if you're too busy to respond, but even a one- or two-line reply would really make my day.

All the best,
Tim

This is something that I have used and was able to contact many people that I look up to on the internet. 🤩

So try cold emailing or messaging someone today. There’s very high upside for practically non existent downside. 📈

Stay Epic! ✌🏽
