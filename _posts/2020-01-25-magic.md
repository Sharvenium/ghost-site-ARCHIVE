This blog post is a bit different from the usual insanely original insightful productivity, life advice blog that I publish. I decided to write about a niche that I decided to dwell into recently. As the title suggests, it is about &#8216;Magic&#8217;.

You might have read about Magic in fantasy fiction books such as the extremely popular Harry Potter franchise or seen mind blowing videos about acts on America&#8217;s Got Talent of or Britain&#8217;s Got Talent in your recommended feed on YouTube. I used to watch these videos and be amazed before continuing on with my day. However, recently I decided to buy a pack of cards for a dollar and figure out what this whole &#8216;magic&#8217; thing is.<figure class="wp-block-image">

### Everything is an illusion

It seems like the audience member chosen is random but it may not be.

It seems as though the magician had predicted what color crayon the judge would choose when in reality with a turn of the crayon box, all the crayons were now red.

It seems as if the person escaped from a death &#8216;trap&#8217; when in reality the person hid in a tiny box underneath the trap and walked infront of the judges in the dark.

It seems as if the 10 year old who watched magic videos on YouTube is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore when he finds out your playing card after using the simple 27 card trick you can learn by watching a 5 minute YouTube video.

### Practice

Just like any other cool hobby, you need to practice a lot if you want to suddenly make the card change or make a coin disappear. It took me about 2 hours to learn a cool pen swirling trick after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvytweSNkiE) by Ali Abdaal. This is something that takes a lot of time. You can&#8217;t just learn how to make a coin disappear out of thin air after watching the relatively low barrier to entry videos about magic. You need to dedicate time to learning and practicing the craft to hone your skills.

I am currently also on a pursuit to learn other &#8216;useless&#8217; skills such as spinning a book, spinning a basketball, flipping my phone and so on. Similar to learning magic tricks which take hours to learn, these skills have tested my sanity and whether I can sit on my bed trying to spin my iPad for an hour while watching [Mike Boyd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIRiWCPZoUyZDbydIqitHtQ) inspire me to learn other skills which I can live without.

### The End

This brings me to the end of this blog post where I share the basic idea of magic and the struggles of practicing consistently with a little bit of the ramble about me learning useless cool skills. If you are reading this, I apologize for the sub-par quality blog and I have linked some hopefully beneficial blogs written by me below.

Stay Epic,
