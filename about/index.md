<p style="text-align:center;">Hey there, welcome to my corner on the internet</p>

## What I'm working on

1. 🎓 I'm a student studying in Singapore 
2. 🎥 I occasionally upload videos on my [YouTube Channel ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-rurif7Y01qNfH2-5N7ZzQ)about tech, books and other cool nerdy stuff.
3. 👨‍💻 On this website, I post articles at least once a week about life advice, productivity, book reviews and other creative stuff that I discover on the internet. 
4. 📨 I also have a newsletter called "Sunday Stories" over at [substack](https://sharvenium.substack.com) where I share _things that I learnt that week_ and _interesting links that I found_.
