I have learnt lots about values from amazing people such as Cliff Weitzman, Benjamin Franklin, Ray Dalio, Valentin Perez, Bob Iger, Derek Sivers and so much more. The golden rule is to not follow other people's values blindly. 

You can get inspiration from other people's values and try experimenting with them but eventually you have to find out what is it that you truly value and what values you want to uphold. 

Here are mine. ⭐️

📈 Growth Mindset - Failure isn't the end. It is a lesson. The more you fail, the more you can learn what not to do. For every 100 failures, there is sure to be one massive success. 


📚 Read Books - Books are highly concentrated in lessons that the author has learnt through their own experiences. There is a reason why most successful people are voracious readers.

🤓 Working Smart - Many people say you need to work hard to achieve success and I agree. But eventually there is diminishing returns on any endeavour. Work smart to find out precisely the least amount of work you can do for the greatest result. After that any work is not necessary unless that is your life mission. You can study for 2 hours a day using efficient study methods and get 80% for the test or you can study for 6 hours a day and get 85%.

🕹 The Dichotomy of Control - Most of the time when we are angry or stressed it's because of an event or person. However in most circumstances you cannot change the event or person. So what is the point of being angry or stressed. Unfortuntely no matter how many times you cry or scream nothing is going to change. You might as well realise that you have no control over the situation and do something else.

But in some situations, you are in control of what is happening. Setting a goal such as "Get a perfect score" is not within your control as not matter how well you wrote your essay, the marker might think you could have done better. Instead focus on what you control such as "Writing a good essay".

🌎 Personal Agency - It's the belief that you can change the world around you. In the Dichotomy of Control, I mentioned that in **most** circumstances you cannot change the event or person. 

However, sometimes you can. When you have a such as strong sense of personal agency and belief that you are better than what you are actually capable of, you can change the event. Checkout this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73uxUkZFaw&t=3s)!

🏋️‍♀️ Discipline - [Motivation is a Myth: Discipline > Motivation](https://aliabdaal.com/motivation-is-a-myth/) by Ali Abdaal is one of my favourite articles to revist once in a while when I am in a rut. It talks about how motivation does not last and that only children do things because they feel like doing things. In an ideal world, an adult (or teenager :D) will do things not based on how they feel like but on what they know they have to do. Although we do not live in an ideal world, it doesn't hurt to try :)

😁 Be Kind - Being Kind is seriously underrated. Being kind and helpful to others feels nice and fulfiling allowing you to form close bonds with people. It can also be useful in a disagreement. No one wants to be told "No". We are all humans and want some form of social approval. 

Instead you can actually try to understand a person's differing belief and offer suggestions that you think might be useful. This is way more effective than putting someone down by saying that their ideas are "wrong". After all would you bother listening to someone who just told you that your ideas are all wrong? Probably not. You can read "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie to learn more.
