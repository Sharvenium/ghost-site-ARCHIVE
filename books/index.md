# List of all the books I have read (110+)
Still missing a few from when I was in primary school but slowly adding in stuff. The books at the top are the books that I have read recently/ am reading now. 

Also if you are reading this, you probably have read lots of books. I suggest you to also have a favourite books page and a list of all the books that you have ever read even if it is just a couple of pages. Although it might take a while, it will be cool 😎. Here are some cool people that do this. 

- [Derek Siver's Book Notes](https://sive.rs/book)
- [Sahil Lavingia's Recommended Books](https://www.notion.so/Sahil-s-Recommended-Books-11f285f4bba6471f9d2cd19dd7c1f4d1)
- [Valentin Perez's Book Notes](https://www.notion.so/My-Book-Notes-f7778ffb7914431c9cb2aabf1b8ce880)
